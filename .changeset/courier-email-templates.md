Production-grade, composable email templates. Templates are now **body
fragments** injected into a shared branded layout shell (`templates/layout.ts`)
— a cross-client-hardened responsive frame (max-width card, hybrid inline +
`<style>` CSS, mobile media query, Outlook VML shim) with a small retunable
theme token set (`EMAIL_THEME`). One shell, many bodies: the DB and FS resolvers
both compose it, so every transactional email renders the same frame for free.

Seeds now ship the templates auth and workspaces actually send —
`email-verification`, `password-reset`, `workspace-invitation`, `email-changed`
(previously only `email-verification` was seeded; the rest fell through to a raw
JSON debug fallback). Founders can override the whole shell by storing a
`_layout` template (DB row or `_layout.html` file); a template that is already a
full HTML document is passed through untouched (never double-wrapped).
