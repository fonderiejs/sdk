Complete the auth-cookie fix across every response egress. The same `Set-Cookie` mangling fixed in `@fonderie/adapter-express` also existed in `@fonderie/adapter-koa` and in `@fonderie/core`'s built-in `app.listen()` HTTP server: forwarding headers with `forEach` + `set()`/`setHeader()` overwrites all but the last `Set-Cookie`, so cookie-based auth silently broke there too. Both now forward the full list via `getSetCookie()`. `@fonderie/adapter-hono` was already correct (it returns the Web `Response` natively). Found by auditing sibling packages after the express fix.
