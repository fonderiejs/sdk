# Finding: discovery-reliability edge case + how to actually cover it

_2026-07-21. Surfaced by the N=3 batch (full 39-point rubric): pb scored 39/27/38
across sequences — one sequence (pb-2) shipped an incomplete app. This documents
the root cause and the honest engineering approach to covering it._

## The finding

In pb-2's **teams** session the model called `brain_query`, got the correct
`@fonderie/workspaces` answer + recipe — then **stopped to ask**: *"OK to add
these two dependencies? Which email provider?"* In a non-interactive run
(`claude -p </dev/null`) there is no one to answer, so the session ended with
teams/audit unbuilt (27/39). Two compounding factors:

1. **Autonomy:** the model asked instead of proceeding. pb-1 and pb-3 hit the
   identical discovery moment and just installed + built (39, 38). Same signals,
   different choice — model variance.
2. **A version-skew banner** read *"...before trusting it,"* nudging caution.

So the failure mode is **silent incompletion on a capability that required
installing a not-yet-present package.**

## Why the first fix is necessary but NOT coverage

The shipped fix (PR #30) made the guidance directive: *"when brain_query names an
uninstalled package, npm install + wire + continue; don't ask permission or
abandon; pick sensible defaults."* Plus a calmer, actionable version banner.

**This is the weakest layer, by the project's own R1 principle:** BRAIN_PLAN's
thesis is *"deterministic enforcement; doesn't rely on the model obeying
instructions."* A prompt telling the model "don't stall" is exactly the
instruction-reliance R1 was built to replace. An LLM will sometimes stall no
matter how good the wording. Guidance **reduces frequency; it cannot cover the
case.** Claiming coverage from Layer 1 alone would repeat the mistake.

## The right approach — defense in depth (weakest → strongest)

**Layer 1 — Directive guidance (DONE, #30).** Lowers probability. Necessary,
insufficient. Never the coverage claim.

**Layer 2 — Deterministic completion detection (LOAD-BEARING, to build).** The
failure is *detectable without trusting the model*: the task asked for teams, the
app shipped without the workspace routes/tables it implies. A post-session check
(or a Stop hook) that verifies the requested capability actually landed, and on
failure **re-invokes with a corrective directive or fails loudly — never passes
silently.** In production terms: a hook that notices "capability requested,
providing package absent, model didn't install it" and surfaces the exact
`npm i @fonderie/workspaces` instead of a dead-end. This is graphify's hook
mechanism — already the R1 plan. This is what *covers* the case.

**Layer 3 — Remove the friction that triggers the stall (root causes):**
- **Spurious skew:** discovery (`brain_query`) still compares against the central
  brain, not the installed co-located fragment, so it warns even when the
  installed package is fine (it warned on pb-2's `core 0.1.2` vs central `0.1.5`).
  Wire discovery to the installed fragment → the alarm disappears.
- **Decision points:** the "which email provider?" question was a place to stop.
  Give the brain a default provider recipe so there is nothing to ask.

**Layer 4 — Gate it (meta).** By R4 ("no claim without a gate"), silent
incompletion should be caught AT the gate, not weeks later by a rubric. A
per-session **completion gate** makes an incomplete session unable to pass —
turning "found in post-hoc scoring" into "the harness refuses to green it."

## Status

- [x] Layer 1 — guidance (#30)
- [ ] Layer 2 — deterministic completion detect-and-recover (the real coverage)
- [ ] Layer 3a — discovery uses the installed fragment (kills spurious skew)
- [ ] Layer 3b — default provider recipe (removes a decision point)
- [ ] Layer 4 — per-session completion gate in the harness

## Verification note (Layer 1 only)

A single re-run (`pb-verify`, sessions 1→3) tests Layer 1 on the exact scenario.
**Preliminary:** the teams session did NOT stall — it installed
`@fonderie/workspaces` and proceeded to build (contrast pb-2's decline). One
sample of a probabilistic mitigation is encouraging, **not** coverage. Layers
2–4 are still required to *ensure* the edge case is covered, because "usually
proceeds" is not "always completes."
